# frontend-store
Frontend of a simple web store - using only HTML and CSS

This project was created as part of the activities of the course "Desarrollo Web Completo" from Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/share/1013eaBEcadVlWQXQ=/)
The purpose of this project was to practice all the concepts learned earlier in the course. This web site was built only with HTML5 and CSS3. It is a simulation of an online store, but it doesn't include any backend development.
